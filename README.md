# Machine_Learning_for_Metabolomics
This repository contains the code of the final project of my master's degree entitled "Bioinformatic approach to assess menopause-related molecular profiles and cardiovascular risk". Specifically, you will find the following content:

* Preprocessing.Rmd: This file contains the scripts for data preprocessing, including missing data imputation, homology reduction and other steps required to prepare the dataset for analysis.

* LR.Rmd: This file documents the implementation of Logistic Regression models, including a specifically developed function to simplify obtaining the best model when testing different values of α and λ. Additionally, it details the model creation, evaluation, result interpretation, and feature importance analysis, as well as the ability to externally adjust sampling and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

* RF.Rmd: This file contains the code for developing Random Forest models, including parameter tuning and performance evaluation.

* XGBoost.Rmd: This file covers the implementation of XGBoost models, focusing on hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
